 **Exactly-Once Payment Processing System**
🧠 Overview

This project implements a fault-tolerant payment processing system that guarantees exactly-once money movement across distributed services.

In real-world banking systems, retries, timeouts, and partial failures can lead to:

Duplicate debits
Missing credits
Inconsistent balances

This system addresses those issues using idempotency, state machines, and a double-entry ledger, ensuring financial correctness under failure conditions.

***Problem Statement***

Distributed financial systems cannot rely on simple request-response guarantees due to:

Network retries
Service crashes
Concurrent requests
Partial transaction execution

The challenge is to ensure:

Money is neither created nor destroyed, and every transaction executes exactly once.

***System Design***
 Transaction Lifecycle (State Machine)
INIT → AUTHORIZED → SETTLED
        ↓
      FAILED
INIT → Transaction created
AUTHORIZED → Debit validated
SETTLED → Debit + Credit completed
FAILED → Transaction aborted safely
 Double-Entry Ledger

Every transaction is recorded as:

Account	Debit	Credit
Sender Account	100	
Receiver Account		100

✔ Ensures:

Total Debit = Total Credit
No money creation/destruction
 Idempotency Layer

Each request includes an Idempotency Key:

Prevents duplicate execution
Returns same response for repeated requests
Handles retries safely
⚙️ Core Components
API Layer → Accepts transaction requests
Idempotency Service → Deduplicates requests
Transaction Engine → Manages state transitions
Ledger Service → Maintains financial records
Database → Persistent storage
Cache (Redis) → Fast idempotency + locking
🧪 Failure Handling

***System is designed to handle:***

 Duplicate API retries
Timeout after debit but before credit
Service crash during processing
Concurrent transaction requests
Recovery Strategy
Replay-safe operations
State-based recovery
Ledger invariants validation
***Key Features***
Exactly-once transaction processing
Strong financial consistency
Replay-safe architecture
Deterministic state transitions
Double-entry accounting system
Failure simulation and recovery
*** Tech Stack ***
Language: Java
Framework: Spring Boot
Database: SQLite (Production-ready ACID compliance)
Concurrency: Java 22 Virtual Threads
Architecture: REST APIs + Double-Entry Ledger

***How It Works (Flow)***
Client sends transaction request with idempotency key
System checks if request already processed
If new:
Create transaction (INIT)
Move to AUTHORIZED
Execute debit + credit
Move to SETTLED
Ledger updated with both entries
Response returned
***Challenges Addressed***
Ensuring exactly-once semantics without distributed locks
Handling partial failures safely
Maintaining ledger consistency under concurrency
Designing replay-safe transaction processing
*** Future Improvements***
Kafka-based event streaming
Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
Multi-currency ledger support
Horizontal scaling with sharding
Stronger consistency via consensus mechanisms
*** Key Learnings***
Financial systems require strong invariants, not eventual consistency
Idempotency is critical for safe retries
State machines simplify complex workflows
Ledger design is central to system correctness
***Disclaimer

This project is a simulation of real-world financial systems designed for learning and demonstration purposes.
It does not represent a production-ready banking system.
